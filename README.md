# Big-Data-Project
We applied machine learning algorithms and neural networks to train data for efficient recognition of handwritten digits, ensuring maximum accuracy on validation data, to address common issues in data processing such as incorrect mail delivery and erroneous financial transactions.
We evaluated and compared the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms and neural networks, including Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine, and Convolutional Neural Network, achieving validation accuracy of up to 99.357%, and developing an accurate and efficient method for recognizing handwritten digits in a range of applications.
