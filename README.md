Digit Recognizer using Machine Learning and Neural Networks
We come across handwritten digits in almost every walk of life - postal mails, data entered on
forms, bank cheques etc. Most of these have to be dealt with, through scanning the documents on
which these digits are written. Itâ€™s important for the digits to not be read incorrectly. Otherwise,
mails could be delivered to wrong addresses, incorrect bank account numbers or incorrect amounts
read from the cheques could lead to check bounces or incorrect transactions.
The problem at hand is to use machine learning algorithms & neural networks to train the data in
such a way that one of them efficiently recognizes handwritten digits with as much maximum
accuracy as possible on the validation data.
